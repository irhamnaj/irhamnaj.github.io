A small startup can afford to target users based on some rules like demographics. But, for companies with sizes as same as Tokopedia and Bukalapak with million daily customers and transaction. they have got to graduate to a more sophisticated method to target their marketing.

One such approach is  Cluster Analysis, Use mathematical methods to discover groups of similar customers based on many criteria such as customer daily habit, demographic, economic condition, and other characteristics.

one major purpose of the above approach is to get the right cluster (group) of data that can be used by marketing team to maximize the company budget for marketing campaigns like discounts or product offers.

In this Project, I will then use RFM Analysis and the k-means unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm to group these customers into clusters.
