## Hello all
My name is Irham Najmudin. I was graduate with a B.Sc degree in Physics and has passionate to help people with solving their problems using data.

I just finished my training and intern in one of biggest data-consultant startup in Indonesia where I receive solid training in Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming. I'm Proficient in Python and Excel, data retrieval dan processing with SQL, data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Tableau. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data. I have completed several Data Science and Data Analyst Project, Where i analyst data, built and tuned machine learning models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and etc. More detail can be found in page Project or my [Github](https://github.com/irhamnaj/)

I love connecting the dots, whether it's finding the most elegant way to solve data-related problems or writing a line of code. I love the challenge of finding a way and finding a solution. This gave me new insights and perspectives that could be useful when sharing with others or to solve data-related problems in the future.
