## hello all
My name is Irham Najmudin. I was graduate with a B.Sc degree in Physics and has passionate to help people with solving their problems using data. now, I am on my 'adventure' to learn everything about data (especially, statistics, machin learning, and data visualization), how to solve the data-related problem in the most elegant way, and building collaboration with other people to create connection, friend, and sharing knowledge. Pursuing my career as a data scientist has become my biggest dream right now.
